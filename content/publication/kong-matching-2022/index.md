abstract: Mapping canopy photosynthesis in both high spatial and temporal resolution
  is essential for carbon cycle monitoring in heterogeneous areas. However, well established
  satellites in sun-synchronous orbits such as Sentinel-2, Landsat and MODIS can only
  provide either high spatial or high temporal resolution but not both. Recently established
  CubeSat satellite constellations have created an opportunity to overcome this resolution
  trade-off. In particular, Planet Fusion allows full utilization of the CubeSat data
  resolution and coverage while maintaining high radiometric quality. In this study,
  we used the Planet Fusion surface reflectance product to calculate daily, 3-m resolution,
  gap-free maps of the near-infrared radiation reflected from vegetation (NIRvP).
  We then evaluated the performance of these NIRvP maps for estimating canopy photosynthesis
  by comparing with data from a flux tower network in Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,
  California, USA. Overall, NIRvP maps captured temporal variations in canopy photosynthesis
  of individual sites, despite changes in water extent in the wetlands and frequent
  mowing in the crop fields. When combining data from all sites, however, we found
  that robust agreement between NIRvP maps and canopy photosynthesis could only be
  achieved when matching NIRvP maps to the flux tower footprints. In this case of
  matched footprints, NIRvP maps showed considerably better performance than in situ
  NIRvP in estimating canopy photosynthesis both for daily sum and data around the
  time of satellite overpass (R2 = 0.78 vs. 0.60, for maps vs. in situ for the satellite
  overpass time case). This difference in performance was mostly due to the higher
  degree of consistency in slopes of NIRvP-canopy photosynthesis relationships across
  the study sites for flux tower footprint-matched maps. Our results show the importance
  of matching satellite observations to the flux tower footprint and demonstrate the
  potential of CubeSat constellation imagery to monitor canopy photosynthesis remotely
  at high spatio-temporal resolution.
