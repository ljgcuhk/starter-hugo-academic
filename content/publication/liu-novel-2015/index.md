abstract: Methane (CHtextlessinftextgreater4textless/inftextgreater) is a powerful
  greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 28 times that of carbon dioxide (COtextlessinftextgreater2textless/inftextgreater).
  CHtextlessinftextgreater4textless/inftextgreater is responsible for approximately
  20% of the Earth's warming since pre-industrial times. Knowledge of the sources
  of CHtextlessinftextgreater4textless/inftextgreater is crucial due to the recent
  substantial interannual variability of growth rates and uncertainties regarding
  individual sources. The prevailing paradigm is that methanogenesis carried out by
  methanogenic archaea occurs primarily under strictly anaerobic conditions. However,
  in the past decade, studies have confirmed direct CHtextlessinftextgreater4textless/inftextgreater
  release from three important kingdoms of eukaryotes-Plantae, Animalia and Fungi-even
  in the presence of oxygen. This novel CHtextlessinftextgreater4textless/inftextgreater
  production pathway has been aptly termed \"aerobic CHtextlessinftextgreater4textless/inftextgreater
  production\" to distinguish it from the well-known anaerobic CHtextlessinftextgreater4textless/inftextgreater
  production pathway, which involves catalytic activity by methanogenic archaeal enzymes.
  In this review, we collated recent experimental evidence from the published literature
  and documented this novel pathway of direct CHtextlessinftextgreater4textless/inftextgreater
  production and emission by eukaryotes. The mechanisms involved in this pathway may
  be related to protective strategies of eukaryotes in response to changing environmental
  stresses, with CHtextlessinftextgreater4textless/inftextgreater a by-product or
  end-product during or at the end of the process(es) that originates from organic
  methyl-type compounds. Based on the existing, albeit uncertain estimates, plants
  seem to contribute less to the global CHtextlessinftextgreater4textless/inftextgreater
  budget (3-24%) compared to previous estimates (10-37%). We still lack estimates
  of CHtextlessinftextgreater4textless/inftextgreater emissions by animals and fungi.
  Overall, there is an urgent need to identify the precursors for this novel CHtextlessinftextgreater4textless/inftextgreater
  source and improve our understanding of the mechanisms of direct CHtextlessinftextgreater4textless/inftextgreater
  production and the impacts of environmental stresses. An estimate of this new CHtextlessinftextgreater4textless/inftextgreater
  source, which was not considered as a CHtextlessinftextgreater4textless/inftextgreater
  source by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2013), could be
  useful for better quantitation of the global CHtextlessinftextgreater4textless/inftextgreater
  budget.
