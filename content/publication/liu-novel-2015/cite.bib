 abstract = {Methane (CH\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater) is a powerful greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 28 times that of carbon dioxide (CO\textlessinf\textgreater2\textless/inf\textgreater). CH\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater is responsible for approximately 20% of the Earth's warming since pre-industrial times. Knowledge of the sources of CH\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater is crucial due to the recent substantial interannual variability of growth rates and uncertainties regarding individual sources. The prevailing paradigm is that methanogenesis carried out by methanogenic archaea occurs primarily under strictly anaerobic conditions. However, in the past decade, studies have confirmed direct CH\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater release from three important kingdoms of eukaryotes-Plantae, Animalia and Fungi-even in the presence of oxygen. This novel CH\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater production pathway has been aptly termed "aerobic CH\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater production" to distinguish it from the well-known anaerobic CH\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater production pathway, which involves catalytic activity by methanogenic archaeal enzymes. In this review, we collated recent experimental evidence from the published literature and documented this novel pathway of direct CH\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater production and emission by eukaryotes. The mechanisms involved in this pathway may be related to protective strategies of eukaryotes in response to changing environmental stresses, with CH\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater a by-product or end-product during or at the end of the process(es) that originates from organic methyl-type compounds. Based on the existing, albeit uncertain estimates, plants seem to contribute less to the global CH\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater budget (3-24%) compared to previous estimates (10-37%). We still lack estimates of CH\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater emissions by animals and fungi. Overall, there is an urgent need to identify the precursors for this novel CH\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater source and improve our understanding of the mechanisms of direct CH\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater production and the impacts of environmental stresses. An estimate of this new CH\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater source, which was not considered as a CH\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater source by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2013), could be useful for better quantitation of the global CH\textlessinf\textgreater4\textless/inf\textgreater budget.},
