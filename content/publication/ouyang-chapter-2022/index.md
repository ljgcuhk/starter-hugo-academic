abstract: Coastal wetlands have one of the highest carbon sequestration rates among
  the world’s natural ecosystems mainly because of their high primary productivity
  and low rate of ecosystem respiration. Meanwhile, they are often assumed to be minor
  sources of methane (CH4), a highly potent greenhouse gas (GHG), under the influence
  of high salinity. On the other hand, frequent inundation and anaerobic environment
  make coastal wetlands potential sources of CH4 if other favorable conditions are
  met. Accurate quantification of the magnitude and direction of biosphere-atmosphere
  exchange of GHGs, including carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4, is essential for a comprehensive
  assessment of the climatic impact of coastal wetlands. The eddy covariance technique
  allows for the direct, quasicontinuous, and long-term measurements of ecosystem-scale
  GHG fluxes and has been increasingly used in coastal wetland ecosystems. In this
  chapter, we briefly introduce the basics of the eddy covariance technique, followed
  by a synthesis of biosphere-atmosphere exchange of CO2 and CH4 in coastal mangroves
  and salt marshes, with a particular focus on the temporal variability and biophysical
  drivers.
