abstract: Mangroves are complex ecosystems subject to periodic and irregular changes
  in meteorology, tides, water quality and biological factors. Methane dynamics in
  mangroves and their dependence on biogeochemical controls across scales are poorly
  characterized using traditional parametric statistics. We measured the ecosystem-scale
  methane flux (FCH4) using an eddy covariance system in a subtropical estuarine mangrove
  for two years. A combination of nonparametric statistical approaches, including
  singular spectrum analysis and information theory, was used to isolate multiscale
  FCH4 variations and explore their variability and dominant controls at different
  time scales. FCH4 exhibited the largest variability at the diel scale (57%), followed
  by seasonal (25%) and multiday (18%) scales. Mutual information metrics suggested
  that variation in FCH4 was dominantly coupled to plant activities through synchronous
  processes at the diel scale. Moreover, fluctuations in atmospheric turbulence and
  soil temperature dominated multiday variation in FCH4 through asynchronous processes.
  Seasonally, soil temperature and water salinity were dominant variables leading
  to changes in FCH4 with a time lag of 12 and 17 days, respectively. Weak links between
  FCH4 and tidal heights were found across all the studied time scales. Transfer entropy
  metrics indicated that a super typhoon event substantially weakened causal links
  between biophysical variables and FCH4 by causing severe defoliation and disturbing
  the soil microbial community. The typhoon also temporarily decoupled the causal
  link between FCH4 and temperature. These findings call for the inclusion of the
  properties of scale emergence, nonlinearity, asynchrony and causality for comprehensively
  understanding and accurately predicting the interactions between mangrove FCH4 and
  its biophysical controls.
