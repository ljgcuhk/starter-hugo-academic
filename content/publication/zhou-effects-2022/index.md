abstract: The addition of external carbon sources is crucial for effective biological
  treatment of nutrient-rich but carbondepleted hydroponic wastewater using constructed
  wetlands. In this study, we examined the effects of applying three types of carbon
  substrates, namely sucrose, hydroponic kale residues, and common reed litter, on
  the nutrient removal efficiency and greenhouse gas emission rate of vertical flow
  constructed wetlands. The addition of sucrose and common reed litter was shown to
  perform equally well in enhancing the removal of total nitrogen (84.9–93.5%), nitrate
  (98.3–99.8%) and phosphate (53.8–55.2%) as compared to the control. Moreover, the
  application of common reed litter led to significantly lower mean CH4 and N2O emissions
  than that of kale residues. These findings suggested that Phragmites reed litter,
  which is easily found in wetlands worldwide, could be an effective, low-cost and
  climate-friendly carbon substrate to be applied in constructed wetlands for hy­
  droponic wastewater treatment.
