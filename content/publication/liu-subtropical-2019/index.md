abstract: Coastal mangrove wetlands have an excellent potential in sequestrating atmospheric
  carbon dioxide (CO2) owing to their high primary productivity as well as slow anaerobic
  decomposition of organic matter. Yet, there is hitherto a paucity of researches
  examining the temporal variations and environmental controls of ecosystemscale CO2
  fluxes in subtropical mangroves using quasi-continuous, high temporal resolution
  measurements. In this study, we measured the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) between
  the atmosphere and a subtropical estuarine mangrove dominated by Kandelia obovata
  using an eddy covariance system for two full years to investigate the seasonal variability
  and key biophysical drivers of NEE. During the wet seasons, the magnitude of increase
  in ecosystem respiration (Re) was greater than that in gross primary productivity
  (GPP) owing to a combination of higher temperature and lower percentage of inundation,
  tidal height and water salinity, which subsequently resulted in an overall decrease
  in net CO2 uptake as compared to the dry seasons. Our results of path analysis showed
  that temperature was a dominant control of the temporal variations in CO2 flux during
  the wet seasons, while its influence became weaker during the dry seasons. On the
  other hand, an increase in water salinity during the dry seasons had a positive
  influence on GPP, which was likely related to a greater availability of ions (mainly
  Cl− and Na+) in supporting photosynthesis by mangrove trees in this coastal wetland
  with relatively low salinity (∼5–15 ppt). Our subtropical mangrove wetland was shown
  to be a significant carbon (C) sink, with annual C uptake rates of 890 and 758 g
  CO2-C m-2 yr−1 in the two years of study. We found a strong control of mangrove
  CO2 fluxes by biophysical factors such as temperature and salinity, implying that
  global warming and a reduction in water salinity in response to a greater river
  discharge could potentially reduce the C sink strength of estuarine mangroves in
  the subtropical regions.
