 abstract = {Coastal mangrove wetlands have an excellent potential in sequestrating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) owing to their high primary productivity as well as slow anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. Yet, there is hitherto a paucity of researches examining the temporal variations and environmental controls of ecosystemscale CO2 fluxes in subtropical mangroves using quasi-continuous, high temporal resolution measurements. In this study, we measured the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) between the atmosphere and a subtropical estuarine mangrove dominated by Kandelia obovata using an eddy covariance system for two full years to investigate the seasonal variability and key biophysical drivers of NEE. During the wet seasons, the magnitude of increase in ecosystem respiration (Re) was greater than that in gross primary productivity (GPP) owing to a combination of higher temperature and lower percentage of inundation, tidal height and water salinity, which subsequently resulted in an overall decrease in net CO2 uptake as compared to the dry seasons. Our results of path analysis showed that temperature was a dominant control of the temporal variations in CO2 flux during the wet seasons, while its influence became weaker during the dry seasons. On the other hand, an increase in water salinity during the dry seasons had a positive influence on GPP, which was likely related to a greater availability of ions (mainly Cl− and Na+) in supporting photosynthesis by mangrove trees in this coastal wetland with relatively low salinity (∼5–15 ppt). Our subtropical mangrove wetland was shown to be a significant carbon (C) sink, with annual C uptake rates of 890 and 758 g CO2-C m-2 yr−1 in the two years of study. We found a strong control of mangrove CO2 fluxes by biophysical factors such as temperature and salinity, implying that global warming and a reduction in water salinity in response to a greater river discharge could potentially reduce the C sink strength of estuarine mangroves in the subtropical regions.},
